Adds a number of **quick-toggles** to the **Browser** search bar that allow you to **preserve specific search parameters** across multiple searches, so that you do not have to type them in repeatedly.

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**FEATURES**

By default the add-on comes with four toggles:

*Static*

- Deck (Hotkey: `Alt+D`): Limit results to current deck 
- Card (Hotkey: `Alt+C`): Limit results to first card of each note

*Dynamic*

- Sticky (Hotkey: `Alt+S`): Will remember the entirety of the current query
- Tags (Hotkey: `Alt+T`): Limit results to current tag selection

Static toggles have predefined values, while dynamic ones are extracted from the current search.

Advanced users can customize these toggles and set up additional ones by modifying the configuration section in the source code.

**CREDITS AND LICENSE**

Some of the features in this add-on were inspired by the following fantastic add-ons:

- [Limit searches to current deck](https://github.com/dae/ankiplugins/blob/master/searchdeck.py) by Damien Elmes
- [Ignore accents in browser search](https://github.com/hssm/anki-addons) by Houssam Salem

I would also like to thank [Dmitry Mikheev](https://github.com/ankitest) for his significant contributions to the code-base of the original add-on.

The icons used by this add-on were adapted from previous work by [Tiago Barroso](https://github.com/tmbb/FrozenFields) and [Damien Elmes](https://github.com/dae/anki).

'Sticky Searches' was formerly known as 'Browser Search Modifiers', but has since been reworked from the ground up with the kind support of a fellow Anki user.
